career-profile:
    title: Hi!
    summary: |
      I am a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/research/departments-centers/medical-oncology"><b><u>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</u></b></a> in the Department of Medical Oncology. I combine experimental and computational approaches to uncover the biological mechanisms driving therapeutic resistance and immune responses in rare and treatment-refractory kidney cancers. My work integrates immunology, cancer genetics, and translational genomics to develop personalized immunotherapies and combination treatments. I am also deeply committed to fostering collaboration and mentorship in scientific research.
      
      I completed my PhD in Cancer Immunology from <a href="https://www.dal.ca/"><b><u>Dalhousie University</u></b></a>, where my <a href="https://library-archives.canada.ca/eng/services/services-libraries/theses/Pages/item.aspx?idNumber=1340915557"><b><u>thesis</u></b></a> focused on developing mass-spectrometry based approaches for tumor antigen discovery, and immunogenic photodynamic therapies to enhance T cell-mediated immune responses in mouse melanoma models. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/"><b><u>Indian Institute of Technology Madras</u></b></a>.
      
      Beyond research, I actively advocate for improved mentorship, gender equity, and graduate student mental health. I currently serve in leadership roles within postdoctoral associations and previously co-founded the Graduate Student Peer Support Network at Dalhousie. I'm always happy to connect on science, mentorship, or advocacy.
      
      When I'm not in the lab, you'll likely find me painting, stargazing, or unwinding with a good book, great food, and even better company. I also enjoy being outdoors - whether it's running, biking, or simply exploring. You can check out my current reads on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100071346-prathyusha"><b><u>Goodreads</u></b></a> and my artwork on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/doodlephd/"><b><u>DoodlePhD</u></b></a>.
