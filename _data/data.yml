career-profile:
    title: Hi!
    summary: |
      I am a cancer immunologist and bioinformatician with expertise in various wet lab (immunology/molecular biology) and dry lab (single-cell RNA/ATAC, bulk-RNA/Exome, ChIRP-seq) approaches. My current research is focused on characterizing the tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of therapeutic responses in rare kidney cancers and developing personalized immuno/combination therapies.  I recently completed my Ph.D. in Immunology at Dalhousie University, with <a href="https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/81529"><b><u>thesis work</u></b></a> focused on -- 1) mass spectrometry-based tumor antigen discovery for cancer vaccines, and 2) the development of novel immunogenic photodynamic therapies for melanoma, with a particular emphasis on enhancing T cell-mediated immune responses.
      
      Apart from my academic interests, I am a strong advocate for promoting graduate student mental health and gender equality. In this regard, I was actively involved in creating the Graduate Student Peer Support Network at Dalhousie University. I am always available for discussions on science, women empowerment, or mental health. Please feel free to reach out to me!
      
      In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books, exploring nature, painting, and indulging in good food with good company. You can check out my current reading list on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100071346-prathyusha"><b><u>Goodreads</u></b></a> and my artwork on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/doodlephd/"><b><u>DoodlePhD</u></b></a>. Thank you for visiting.
