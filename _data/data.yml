career-profile:
    title: Hi!
    summary: |
      Hello! I am a postdoctoral fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute / Harvard Medical School, where my current research is focused on genetics and genomics of kidney cancer with a focus on developing personalized cancer immunotherapies. I recently finished my Ph.D. in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Dalhousie University with <a href="https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/81529"><b><u>thesis work</u></b></a> focused on Cancer Immunology. Specifically, my PhD work focused on improving mass spectrometry based tumor antigen discovery and developing novel immunogenic photodynamic therapies for melanoma, with a focus on enhancing T cell mediated immune responses.
      
      Outside of lab, I enjoy promoting and advocating for graduate student mental health and equality and was involved in building the Graduate Student Peer Support Network at Dalhousie University. If you're interested in chatting about science or mental health, feel free to connect! 
      
      My hobbies include reading books, nature walks, painting, and having good food with good people. Check out what I am currently reading here <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100071346-prathyusha"><b><u>Goodreads</u></b></a> and my artwork here <a href="https://www.instagram.com/doodlephd/"><b><u>DoodlePhD</u></b></a>.
